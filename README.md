## Build and deploy

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push the project to a GitHub repository.
2. Import it at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). Vercel detects Next.js automatically.
3. Update `url` in `config/site.ts` to your live domain so Open Graph links and the sitemap point to it.

The template has no environment variables or backend, so no extra setup is needed. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for other hosts.

## Folder structure

```
app/
  (admin)/          Admin area: dashboards, apps, pages, components, modules, utilities
  (auth)/           Authentication screens
  globals.css       Theme tokens (colors, radius, shadows, chart palette)
  layout.tsx        Root layout and site metadata
components/
  layout/           Sidebar, header, user menu, breadcrumb, footer

store/              Redux store and slices
types/              Shared TypeScript types
```

## Customization

### Theme and colors

All colors are CSS variables in `app/globals.css`. Edit `:root` for light mode and `.dark` for dark mode. The primary color is set in the `@theme` block (`--color-primary`), and chart colors use `--chart-1` to `--chart-7`.

### Logo

Replace the files in `public/brand/` and update `components/ui/logo.tsx`. The favicon, Apple icon and Open Graph image are `app/favicon.ico`, `app/icon.png`, `app/apple-icon.png` and `app/opengraph-image.png`.

### Navigation

Add, remove or reorder menu items in `config/navigation.ts`. Each item takes a `title`, `href`, optional Lucide `icon` and optional `children`.

### Site details

Set the name, description, live URL and demo user in `config/site.ts`.

More detail in [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

## Browser support

Latest two versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari (desktop and mobile).
